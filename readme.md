# Balloon Weather + Air Quality Explorer

A simple interactive map combining:

✔ WindBorne Systems 24-hour balloon telemetry  
✔ OpenAQ real-time global air quality data  

## Why this project?
Balloon positions + air quality form the perfect pairing of atmosphere + environmental health.  
I wanted to explore how moving sensors could be matched with ground-level environmental signals.

## Features
- Robust parsing of 24 balloon position JSON files (even when corrupted)
- Visualization using Leaflet.js
- Real-time AQI lookup for each balloon
- Popups showing pollutant data + balloon altitude
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds
- 100% static
